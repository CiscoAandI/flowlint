It can be used to check various rules against these workflows. It was created using Spectral Lint and can be extended easily as such. Each workflow rule was learned over time and thus we wish to pass this learned information on to others. Getting Started Installation Flowlint is a fully dockerized linter that can be used within the docker container in various CI pipelines or locally. It was designed in pure javascript and also can therefore be run in a browser. To install flowlint, simply download the docker container as shown: Install Only docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/ciscoaandi/flowlint/flowlint:${VERSION} Where ${VERSION} is the version you would like to use. See Flowlint Packages for a list of available Flowlint versions. Install & Run docker run -it -v ${PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_JSON}:/workflow.json docker.pkg.github.com/ciscoaandi/flowlint/flowlint:${VERSION} /workflow.json Where ${VERSION} is the version you would like to use.

Example docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/ciscoaandi/flowlint/flowlint:1.0.0 Usage To lint a workflow, simply use the following command: docker run -it -v ${PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_JSON}:/workflow.json docker.pkg.github.com/ciscoaandi/flowlint/flowlint:1.0.0 /workflow.json Where ${PATH_TO_WORKFLOW_JSON} is the filepath to the workflow.json file you would like to lint.
